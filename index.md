# About
Come to talk about code, tools and science, in a social environment. If you have a problem in one of those areas: bring it along and get help. If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to drink a coffee: join us.
The HackyHour is open to all intrested librarians and scientists of the Cologne area and beyond.  

# When and Where

Our meeting takes place on Thursdays from 2-3pm in the Meeting Room at [ZB MED] (https://www.zbmed.de/). In order to secure a peer to peer interaction frontal teaching longer than 15min is dispensed for HackyHour. Discussions are preferred to be held in English or English and German enable international researchers to join the meeting.  

You can come without registration but feel free to join the discussion in the linked pad (see table below) if you have any questions beforehand.
