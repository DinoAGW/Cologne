# About
Come to talk about science in a social environment.
If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to drink a beer: join us.

# When and Where

Our meeting takes place at [ZB MED](https://www.zbmed.de/).

You can come without registration but feel free to join the discussion in the linked pad (see table below) if you have any questions beforehand.


# Topics
In addition to the open discussions we also aim to talk about specific topics at each HackyHour.
However prior knowledge or interest in these topics is not a prerequisite.
Online discussions for these topics are accessible via the following links.
