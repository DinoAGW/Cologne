# About
Come to talk about code, tools and science, in a social environment. If you have a problem in one of those areas: bring it along and get help. If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to drink a coffee: join us.
The HackyHour is open to all intrested librarians and scientists of the Cologne area and beyond.  

# When and Where

Our meeting takes place on Thursdays from 2-3pm in the Meeting Room at [ZB MED] (https://www.zbmed.de/).

You can come without registration but feel free to join the discussion in the linked pad (see table below) if you have any questions beforehand.
